# Myportfolio

I recently designed my own portfolio website using html and css.This is my first website that I created the second week I started bootcamp coding school. It was a challenge for me because it's my first time building a whole website. But I really enjoyed this experience because I  learned a lot from it.
I'll still work on it to get a better result.
